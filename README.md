# snake-and-ladder-game

wrote this in C++ six years ago, need to update this in python. i think i should do this with typescript instead and make it a web app. instead of just doing another cli thing like i always do.


## If you're big on python then...
### This is how to run this shii

1. just clone this repository to your local machine.
2. install Python 3 if you don't have it.
3. then, navigate to the python folder of this repo in terminal.
4. and run this:

   ```bash
   python snake_and_ladder.py
   ```

## If you're a C++ coconutheaded dude, like me...
#### this is how to run this shit

**First, you need:**
- C++17 or higher
- A C++ compiler (i used `g++`)

I already did this command "g++ main.cpp Board.cpp Dice.cpp Player.cpp Game.cpp -o game" into a Makefile for you, so all you have to do after cloning this repo is to just cd into the cpp folder of this repo and then run make.
